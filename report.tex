\subsection{Basic Averages}%
\label{subsec:BasicAverages}%
The follwing statistics were all generated using the sparse vector technique to determine a clipping parameter for the data, and then generating differentially private sums and counts to find a differentially private average.%
\subsubsection{Average Age}%
\label{ssubsec:AverageAge}%
The average age of all credit card customers is 46.33, the differentially private average age of all customers is 46.36. This gives an error of 0.0811\%.

%
\subsubsection{Average Months on Book}%
\label{ssubsec:AverageMonthsonBook}%
The average months on the book of all credit card customers is 35.93, the differentially private average age of all customers is 35.98. This gives an error of 0.1568\%.

%
\subsubsection{Average Credit Limit}%
\label{ssubsec:AverageCreditLimit}%
The average credit limit of all credit card customers is 8631.95, the differentially private average age of all customers is 8615.92. This gives an error of 0.1858\%.

%
\subsection{Basic Counts}%
\label{subsec:BasicCounts}%
The follwing statistics were all generated using the report noisy max method to determine the highest count in a given parameter.%
\subsubsection{Income Categories}%
\label{ssubsec:IncomeCategories}%
The most common income category of all credit card customers is Less than \$40K. The most common income category as determined by using a differentially private method is Less than \$40K.

\subsubsection{Income Categories}%
\label{ssubsec:IncomeCategories}%
The most common education level of all credit card customers is Graduate. The most common education level as determined by using a differentially private method is Graduate.

\label{ssubsec:AverageCreditLimitforCustomers33yearsoldandyounger.}%
The average credit limit of credit card customers who are 33 years old and younger is 7212.7, the differentially private average is 3122.16. This gives an error of 56.713\%.
